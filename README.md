## Abstract

As commonly understood, the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 will undergo mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without the need for specialized treatment. Nevertheless, a subset of individuals may experience severe illness or succumb to the virus, irrespective of age. The dataset utilized in this project originates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and pertains to provisional COVID-19 deaths in the United States, categorized by date, state, sex, and age groups.The primary objective of this project is to address the following questions: Does the incidence of COVID-19-related deaths exhibit a temporal decrease over time? To what extent do COVID-19-related deaths vary based on factors such as state, sex, and age group?
